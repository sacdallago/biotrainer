# Architectural decision record 002 - Trainer Module

In this document we will give an overview about the decision process behind the implementation of the `trainers` module.

## Input/Output distinction

Depending on the protocol we have 3 different possibilities for the input:
1. Residue (Dim: Length of protein x Size of embedding vector)
2. Residues (Dim: Length of protein x Size of embedding vector)
3. Sequence (Dim: 1 x Size of embedding vector)

1 and 2 actually do not differ in the input shape or kind directly, but it has to be handled different by the models.

List of functions related to the kind of input in the trainer class:
```mermaid
classDiagram 
class TrainerInput {
     void _load_embeddings()
     bool _use_reduced_embeddings()
     function _get_collate_function()
     int _get_number_features()
}
```

Depending on the protocol we have also 2 different possibilities for the output:
1. Class (Multinomial or binary prediction)
2. Value (Floating point value)

Both of them can be predicted either for a whole sequence or for every residue.
List of functions related to the kind of output in the trainer class:
```mermaid
classDiagram 
class TrainerOutput {
    void _load_sequences_and_labels()
    void _generate_class_labels()
    void _compute_class_weights()
}
```

There are also some functions that won't change, regardless of the kind of input and output:
```mermaid
classDiagram 
class TrainerGeneral {
    dict _execute_pipeline()
    void _create_dataloaders()
    void _create_model_and_training_params()
    void _do_and_log_training()
    void _do_and_log_evaluation()
}
```

### Decision/Solution:
Trainer class is split up in 3 parts:
* EmbeddingsLoader that only handles loading of the embeddings
* PredictionIOHandler that creates torch datasets from the input files and embeddings
* The Trainer class itself that handles the general aspects of training and is given two instances of the objects above
