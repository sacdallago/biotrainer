# Architectural decision record 001 - Data Standardization

In this document we collect different data standardization strategies for the various prediction tasks.
We will list all possibilities we considered and justify the final decision we made.
The final decision is marked in this document and can also be found in the `data_standardization.md` file in the
base directory.

## Standardization strategies overview

### Residue -> Class
<details>
<summary>Residue -> Class standardization</summary>

**1. 2 Fasta files (sequence.fasta, label.fasta)**

sequences.fasta
```fasta
>Seq1
SEQWENCE
```

labels.fasta
```fasta
>Seq1 SET=train VALIDATION=False
DVCDVVDD
```

PRO:
+ Easy mapping of residue -> class

</details>

### Residue -> Value
<details>
<summary>Residue -> Value standardization</summary>

**1. 1 single CSV file**
```csv
sequence, values, set, validation
PRTEIN, 0.5;0.3;0.2;0.1;1.5;0.01, train, False
```

PRO:
+ Only one file

CON:
- File will be very large and have bad readability

</details>

### Sequence -> Class && Sequence -> Value
<details>
<summary>Sequence -> Class standardization</summary>

**1. 2 Fasta files (sequence.fasta, label.fasta)**

sequences.fasta

```fasta
>Seq1
SEQWENCE
```

labels.fasta

```fasta
>Seq1 SET=train VALIDATION=False
Glob
```

PRO:
+ Compliant with residue -> class structure

CON:
- Fasta interpreters might misinterpret "Glob" as "G, L, O, B"
- 2 files

**2. 1 single Fasta file**
```fasta
# sequences.fasta
>Seq1 TARGET=Glob SET=train VALIDATION=False 
SEQWENCE
```

PRO:
+ Only one file
+ Readability

CON:
- Conversion from FLIP to biotrainer needed

**3. 1 single CSV file**
```csv
sequence, label, set, validation
SEQWENCE, Glob, train, False
```

PRO:
+ Only one file
+ FLIP data format

CON:
- Bad readability for longer sequences
