# inference example

This example shows how to use a model trained with *biotrainer* for inference. It is done by using the
*Inferencer* rather than the *Solver* class. A pretrained model, along with the necessary files, can be found
in the [residue_to_class example](../residue_to_class/). The notebook shows how to use them to predict per-residue
classes for any new sequences.
